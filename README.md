# connecting_wall

This was part of an escape room created for a games night amongst friends.  There are 4 groups of 4 seemingly random clues, if you've seen the show Only Connect (BBC) then you will recognise the idea.  Make the connections, and check with your host to see if they are correct - you can play the game here: http://connectingwall.jamesmcarr.co.uk/ 

Main vue/js is at https://github.com/jamesoncarrwalker/connecting_wall/tree/master/connectingWall/resources/js 

This is a simple SPA using vue-router to navigate - currently housed in Laravel for simplicity and extensibility (e.g. potential to extend and allow game creatation/multiple walls etc via laravel api/axios).  The hosted example is housed independantly (for now) and has a minified js.
