# connecting_wall

This was part of an excape room created for a games night amongst friends.  There are 4 groups of 4 seemingly random clues, if you've seen the show Only Connect (BBC) then you will recognise the idea.  Make the connections, and check with your host to see if they are correct - you can play the game here: www.jamesmcarr.co.uk/connecting_wall - it might be more fun to play first before you look at the code so you don't spoil the fun.  Or you can always be the host!
